# cmpe297_timegpt_tabula_gnn

## Overview

In this repository we explore the se of TimeGTPT for inference and fine-tuning with time series data. Use of tabula for ussing LLMs for generating Synthetic data based on a small sample of real data and use of RelBench for working with relational data (Tables)/

## Files and their Content

1. timegpt_longhorizonforecasting.ipynb
    - In this notebook we look at the use of TimeGPT for making long horizon forecasting (long duration), on energy data.

2. TimeGPT_MultivariantForecasting.ipynb
    - In this notebook, we explore how TimeGPT can handle multovariant dataset and how it can perform forecasting on it.

3. FienTuning_TimeGPT.ipynb
    - In this notebook we finetune the existing TimeGPT model, using our own data.

4. Anomaly_Detection_With_TimeGPT.ipynb
    - In this notebook we demonstrate the use of TimeGPT for anomaly detection in timeseries data

5. Forecasting_Energy_Demand.ipynb
    - Here we use TimeGPT to address the electric energy demand forecasting usecase.

6. Bitcoin_Price_Prediction.ipynb
    - In this notebook we use TimeGPT to address bit coin price forecasting problem.

7. DatasetCreationTabula.ipynb
    - Creating syntheic insuarance data, using Tabula. We fine tune one LLM for data genereation task using our dataset and then we use the finetuned model for data synthetic data generation.

8. ZeroShotWithTabula8b.ipynb
    - Using tabula-8b model for making ZeroHint inference.

9. GAN_with_RelBench.ipynb
    - Using RelBench to train a GAN  on races and drivers relational dataset.
